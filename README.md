calc_app

This is a simple calculator application written in Python. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations and keeps a running history of all calculations in a file.

The application includes the following features:

Basic Arithmetic: Supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).

Calculation History: Records each calculation and its result in a file called equations.txt.

View History: Allows users to view all previous calculations recorded in the history file.

Robust Error Handling: Includes defensive programming to handle invalid user input (e.g., non-numeric input) and prevents division by zero.

To run the application, simply execute the calc_app.py file in a Python environment.
